# TAP Institute 2023 Lesson Template

This repository contains a teaching template for creating a workshop for the 2023 Text Analysis Pedagogy (TAP) Institute. The TAP Institute uses the [Constellate Platform](https://constellate.org) for teaching and learning.

# Copying this template

GitHub has [directions for copying a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make sure your resulting repository is "public".

# Testing your lesson in Constellate

Opening your lesson in Constellate requires at least one Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. This is supplied by the default template. A full workshop may include 3 or more notebook files (e.g. "python-basics-1.ipynb", "python-basics-2.ipynb", "python-basics-3.ipyb"). More files may be required but each lesson should use the same general template.

You can generate a Constellate link for testing your lesson. You'll need to fill in some data about your GitHub repository:

* GitHub repository URL
* Git branch, tag, or commit (optional)
* Path to a particular notebook file (optional)

# Teaching with Constellate

Share the link you generated above with your students. If the class is large, it may take a few minutes for everyone's environment to load.
